## Downloading files: zoom_files_downloader
This script gets all users in your Zoom account and download files from these in your local machine.
All the scripts runs in input file mode and date range mode.

### Using file input mode
![Download files using an input file](diagrams/download_files.jpg?raw=true "Download files using an input file")

`python zoom_files_downloader.py --inputfile inputfile.csv  --outputfile outputfile.csv`

This mode needs a CSV file. Records in the file are defined in utils.CSV_HEADER. At the beginning, it would be difficult to create this file, and that's why you should use this method just when this file has been generated by zoom_files_downloader, zoom_files_delete or vimeo_uploader, executed in date range mode.

### Using date range mode
![Download files using an input file](diagrams/download_zoom.jpg?raw=true "Download files using an input file")

`python zoom_files_downloader.py --daterange YYYY-mm-dd YYYY-mm-dd  --outputfile outputfile.csv`

You can download files between two dates. i.e.

`python zoom_files_downloader.py --daterange 2020-01-01 2020-05-03  --outputfile outputfile.csv`

This mode gets files from Zoom accounts and saves them in local storage.

## Uploading videos to Vimeo: vimeo_uploader
This script uploads video files from Zoom accounts to a Vimeo account, then it organizes these videos in folders and finally, setup a defined preset.
